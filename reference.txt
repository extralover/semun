참고사항

1. 
The coding artifacts consist of three parts as shown below.
Each part folder file is independent, and there are no files used together. Common files are located in the resources folder.
- user : /semun/zoneC
- tax accountant : /semun/zoneB
- administrator : /semun/zoneA

2. Refer to the file below for a list of output pages, and if there is a file to be modified / added in the future, I will fill it update and share it.
- /semun/index.html

3. Currently, most of the users and tax accountant parts are completed, and the admin page will be modified in general, so please refer to the file now.

4. The paths (or links) within the file are all relative paths.

5. The page button has a temporary link. This is a link to make the flow between pages easier to see, and may be different from what is actually applied.

6. A page displaying a step of a user page has all the states on a page, so it is necessary to perform an if else for each state. (There is also a separate reference file.)

7. The text in the data area is temporary. In practice, you need to apply data that fits your state.

8. The pages of the user and tax accountant parts are implemented as a reaction type. It can be seen normally from PC to Mobile.

9. The class name is associated with the css style. It is recommended to use as is.
There are some things that do not have an id, but some are related to label for and javascript (jQuery), you need to confirm when you need to replace it.
